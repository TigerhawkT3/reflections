When I initialized a repository, it turned that folder into a repository containing its
files and folders at the time. I needed to do it to be able to track these reflection
files with Git version control.

The staging area differs from the working directory and the repository in that it is
merely a list of which files from the working directory will be committed to the
repository. It is valuable for the way it allows me to create a "rough draft" of a
commit before pushing it to the repository.
