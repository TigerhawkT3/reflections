There are many reasons for creating a remote repository rather than keeping everything local.
First, the remote repository can serve as a backup in case I lose my local files. Second, I
can work on the project while I'm away from my main computer. Third, the remote repository
can serve as a "known good" snapshot, with production-ready commits. Fourth, a remote repository
like GitHub allows multiple users to remotely collaborate on a project.
